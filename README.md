# ShapeGrammarLanguage

Shape Grammar Language (SGL) is a visual scripting language written for Unity Game engine. It allows complex self similar shapes to be encoded as a set of rules describint the transforms of shapes. Designing Shape Grammars is about breaking down a model into components that can be repeated. Rooms in a building or branches of a tree are examples of this.
